# CetaceaMac
A MacOS App for cetacea.xyz


## To Do

- [ ] Date/Time should update everytime it's saved. Currently just loads on the first read.
- [ ] Warnings should be removed (the ones dealing with constraints)
- [ ] Loading icon instead of "Saving..." label
- [x] Bigger font
- [ ] When the window closes, but the app is still open, there should be a way to re-open the main window 
- [ ] Google Auth instead of hard-coded user :)
